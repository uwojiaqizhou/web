          <p class="text-justify">Vincent van Gogh (March 30, 1853 - July 29, 1890) is generally considered the greatest Dutch painter after Rembrandt,
            though he had little success during his lifetime. Van Gogh produced all of his work (some 900 paintings and 1100 drawings)
            during a period of only 10 years before he succumbed to mental illness (possibly bipolar disorder) and committed suicide.
            His fame grew rapidly after his death especially following a showing of 71 of van Gogh's paintings in Paris on March 17, 1901 (11 years after his death).
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Van Gogh's influence on expressionism, fauvism and early abstraction was enormous, and can be seen in many other aspects of 20th-century art.
            The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is dedicated to Van Gogh's work and that of his contemporaries.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">Several paintings by Van Gogh rank among the most expensive paintings in the world. On March 30,
            1987 Van Gogh's painting Irises was sold for a record $53.9 million at Southeby's, New York.
            On May 15, 1990 his Portrait of Doctor Gachet was sold for $82.5 million at Christie's, thus establishing a new price record
            (see also List of most expensive paintings).

      <h2>Timeline</h2>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal text-justify">
        <dt>1853</dt>
        <dd>Vincent van Gogh is born on 30 March in the small village of Groot-Zundert, Holland to Theodorus van Gogh (1822-1885) and Anna Cornelia née Carbentus (1819-1907).</dd>
        <dt>1862</dt>
        <dd>While still living in Zundert, Vincent attempts his first drawings.</dd>
        <dt>1873</dt>
        <dd>Vincent is transferred to the London branch of Goupil & Cie. He visits the museums and galleries and expands his knowledge of art. Vincent stays in a boarding house run by Mrs. Ursula Loyer. For decades it's been thought that Vincent was in love with Mrs. Loyer's, daughter, Eugenie. Recent evidence, however, suggests that Vincent was, in fact, in love with Caroline Haanebeek--a friend of the Van Gogh family living back in The Netherlands. Vincent's feelings are unreciprocated.</dd>
        <dt>1877</dt>
        <dd>Vincent leaves England and takes a temporary job in a bookshop in Dordrecht. As with his Goupil & Cie position, Vincent shows little interest and behaves abrasively toward his colleagues and clients. Vincent then pursues religious studies in Amsterdam.</dd>
        <dt>1880</dt>
        <dd>A turning point in Vincent's life. Vincent abandons his religious pursuits and devotes himself exclusively to painting the miners and poverty-stricken weavers. Theo begins to financially support Vincent, a situation that would continue until the end of Vincent's life. Later in the year, Vincent undertakes some formal studies of anatomy and perspective at the Academy in Brussels.</dd>
        <dt>1885</dt>
        <dd>After the death of his father in March, Vincent continues with his work and, in early spring, paints what many consider to be his first great work, The Potato Eaters. Vincent expands his experiments to include a greater variety of colours and becomes extremely interested in Japanese woodcuts.</dd>
        <dt>1886</dt>
        <dd>Wishing to continue with some more formal education in the arts, Vincent submits some of his works to the Antwerp Academy and is put in a beginner's class. As expected, Vincent doesn't fit in well with the Academy and leaves. Later in the year Vincent moves to Paris and lives with Theo.</dd>
        <dt>1887</dt>
        <dd>Throughout the year, Vincent continues his work in Paris. He frequents cafes with other painters and argues about art with Bernard and Gauguin. Over the course of the year, Vincent experiments with some different styles, including Japonaiseries and pointillism</dd>
        <dt>1888</dt>
        <dd>A pivotal point in Van Gogh's life. Vincent leaves Paris in February and moves to Arles in the south. At first the bad, winter weather prevents Vincent from working, but once spring arrives Vincent begins painting the flowering Provence landscapes. Vincent eventually moves into the "Yellow House", a dwelling he has rented where he will paint, and from which he hopes to establish an artists' community. Vincent is extremely productive during this period when he paints a number of seaside landscapes (in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer) as well as many of his most famous portraits (including his series of the postman, Joseph Roulin, and his family).</dd>
        <dt>1889</dt>
        <dd>Vincent begins to improve in the new year and leaves the hospital in Arles on 7 January. During the early part of the year, Vincent's mental state fluctuates wildly. At times he is completely calm and coherent; at others he suffers from hallucinations and delusions. Vincent continues to work sporadically from his "Yellow House", but the increasing frequency of his mental breakdowns prompt him, with Theo's help, to enter the Saint Paul-de-Mausole mental asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.</dd>
        <dt>1890</dt>
        <dd>1890 begins much like the previous year with Vincent making various recoveries and breakdowns. As before, he continues to work when he can and, as his life draws to a close, his works gain more and more recognition. On 31 January Theo's wife, Jo, gives birth to a son who they name Vincent Willem. After a serious attack in February lasting two months, it's decided that Vincent should move closer to Theo and be put under the care of Dr. Paul Gachet. Vincent takes a drastic turn for the better during the course of this move and arrives in Paris looking fit and well (in fact, even more fit than his brother who had been suffering from ill health for years). In May Vincent moves to Auvers-sur-Oise, just north-west of Paris and, while under the care of Dr. Gachet, begins to paint with incredible energy, producing more than 80 paintings in the last two months remaining to him.</dd>
        <dt>1891</dt>
        <dd>Theo never recovers from the death of his beloved brother and his health takes a turn for the worse. He dies on 25 January at Utrecht.</dd>
        <dt>1914</dt>
        <dd>Theo's body is exhumed and he is buried in a grave next to Vincent in Auvers-sur-Oise.</dd>
        <dt>1960</dt>
        <dd>The Vincent van Gogh Foundation is created, with a board consisting of V.W. van Gogh, his second wife, and his three children, and an official representing the Dutch government. The Foundation was established to preserve those works of Vincent van Gogh which were part of the family holdings and to eventually house them in a museum built specifically for the vast collection.</dd>
        <dt>1962</dt>
        <dd>The Vincent van Gogh Foundation purchases the collection of art works from V.W. van Gogh with the full cooperation and agreement of the Van Gogh family. The Dutch parliament passed a bill approving the proposal and on 21 July the official agreement was signed between the state and the Vincent van Gogh Foundation.</dd>
        <dt>1973</dt>
        <dd>The Van Gogh Museum is opened on June 2. The museum holds hundreds of Vincent's works as well as a huge archive containing letters and documents.</dd>
        <dt>30 March, 1990</dt>
        <dd>On the centenary of Vincent's death, The Van Gogh Museum mounts a retrospective exhibit including more than 120 paintings.</dd>
        <dt>15 May, 1990</dt>
        <dd>Vincent van Gogh only sold one painting, The Red Vineyard, but on this date The Portrait of Dr. Gachet is sold in auction at Christie's for $82.5 million, the highest price ever paid for a painting.</dd>
        <dt>14 Nov, 1990</dt>
        <dd>Vincent's pen-and-ink rendering, Garden with Flowers sells in a Christie's auction for $8.36 million, making it the highest price ever paid for a drawing.</dd>
        <dt>Present</dt>
        <dd>Countless works continue to be published about Vincent van Gogh, and the new technologies such as the World Wide Web and interactive CD-ROMs bring the story of Vincent's life and works to a new generation of enthusiasts.</dd>
